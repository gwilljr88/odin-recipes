    <h1>Simple American Style Omelette</h1>
    <p>
        Making an American style omelette is all about achieving a golden,
        slightly textured exterior with a fully set(not dry) interior. Unlike the
        french omelette, the american omelette is hearty and usually folded in
        half.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>
            Fillings: Shredded cheese, bacon, diced ham, bell peppers, diced
            onions,...
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep eggs: </strong>In a small bowl, break the york of each egg
            with a fork, lightly wisk eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Heat med(8") skillet: </strong>Place skillet over med-high heat,
            add butter, swirl around until foam has subsides/sizzling, and butter
            has completely melted but not browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The magic: </strong>Pour eggs into the center of the skillet.
            Let set until for a few seconds until edges have set. Gently push the
            edges towards the center while tilting the pan allowing the raw eggs to
            fill the empty spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add filling: </strong>Once the top is mostly set, add toppings
            to <strong>one-half</strong> of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fold it: </strong>Slide a spatula under the unfilled side and
            fold it over the fillings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Finally: </strong>Let sit for another ~30 secs to melt any
            cheese and give the bottom the signature golden brown "American-style"
            finish.
        </li>
        <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em><strong>DO NOT!</strong></em> over wisk eggs, adding a massive
            amount of air will cause the omelette to be rubbery.
        </li>
        <li>Saute any veggies before hand.</li>
        <li>Sprikle a few toppings on the finish product for presentation.</li>
    </ul>
